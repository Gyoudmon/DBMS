A very large batch of components has arrived at a distributor. The batch can be characterized as acceptable
only if the proportion of defective components is at most @math{10%}. The distributor decides to randomly
select @math{10} components and accept the batch only if the number of defective components in the sample
is at most @math{2}.

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          
          @item{What is the probability that the batch will be accepted when the actual proportion of defective is
           @math{1%}? @math{5%}? @math{10%}? @math{20%}? @math{25%}?}

          @item{Let @math{p} denote the actual proportion of defective in the batch. A graph of @math{P}(batch is accepted)
           as a function of @math{p}, with @math{p} on the horizontal axis and @math{P}(batch is accepted) on the
           vertical axis, is called the @italic{operating characteristics curve} for the acceptance sampling plan.
           Use the results of part(1) to sketch this curve for @math{0 <= p <= 1}.}
 
          @item{Repeat parts (1) and (2) with @math{1} replacing @math{2} in the acceptance sampling plan.}
          @item{Repeat parts (1) and (2) with @math{15} replacing @math{10} in the acceptance sampling plan.}
          @item{Which of the three sampling plans, that of part (1), (3), or (4), appears most satisfactory, and why? }
